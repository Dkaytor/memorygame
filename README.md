#memory

This is a version of the classic memory game.
You have 12 pictures of different animals.
You need to click on each animal once until you have clicked all 12 animals.
If you are able to pick all 12 animals without hitting the same one twice,
you have won!
If you pick the same one twice you lose.
The counter keeps track of how many animals you have clicked.
If you win, the top score goes up by one.

This app uses react as the front end.
